# Event Watch

Occasionally Columbia's Event Mangement decides to change the room that your event is booked in.
Sadly they do not notify you of these changes typically.
Event Watch checks your bookings every hour and sends you an email with all changes in the case that one of the details of the reservation changes.


### Configuration

The following environment variables are used to configure Event Watch:

```
UEM_ORGANIZATION
SENDGRID_USER
SENDGRID_KEY
SENDER
RECIPIENT
```
